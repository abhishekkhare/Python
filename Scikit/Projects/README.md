- **Classification** is supervised learning in which the response is categorical
- **Regression** is supervised learning in which the response is ordered and continuous

### Requirements for working with data in scikit-learn
- Features and response are separate objects
- Features and response should be numeric
- Features and response should be NumPy arrays
- Features and response should have specific shapes
